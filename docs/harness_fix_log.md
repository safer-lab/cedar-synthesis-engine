# Harness Fixes for LLM-Driven Cedar Policy Synthesis
*A Chronological Record Reformatted as a System Paper*

## Abstract

We describe the evolution of an evaluation and feedback harness for a two-phase CEGIS (Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis) loop that synthesizes Cedar access-control policies from natural-language specifications. Phase 1 (planner) decomposes a specification into a verification plan and reference policies; Phase 2 (synthesizer) iteratively proposes candidates that are checked by a symbolic verifier (`cedar symcc`) and a type-checker (`cedar validate`). The harness's central thesis is that a structured signal layer can uplift a small, cheap synthesizer model into producing correct Cedar policies it could not write on its own — making CEGIS for policy practical at production cost levels.

We document eleven categories of fixes made during development, culminating in eleven novel contributions that materially changed convergence behavior: directional feedback signaling, hash-based cross-gate oscillation detection, a Phase 1.25 reference self-validation gate, a parse-vs-type-check error bifurcation, a Phase 0.5 input-schema sanity check, a role-intersection trap detector for floor failures, a Phase 0.55 spec sanity check, a Phase 1 floor-bound consistency rule, a Cedar datetime/duration syntax detector with positive-template feedback, an entity-graph membership liveness limitation with a schema design rule workaround, and a ternary operator syntax detector with boolean-logic rewrite templates. On the `opus_planner_full` benchmark, scenarios that plateaued at 0/24 iterations under the original harness converged in 4–5 iterations after the first four fixes. On four CedarBench domains (GitHub: 14 scenarios; Clinical: 11 scenarios; DocCloud: 10 scenarios; Streaming: 1 scenario so far), the post-fix harness converged on **36/36 scenarios in a mean of 2.42 iterations** (out of 20 max), with six pre-fix 20/20 FAIL scenarios (`github_add_contributor`, `clinical_add_export`, `clinical_full_expansion`, `clinical_add_sponsor`, `doccloud_org_isolation`, `streaming_base`) recovering to 2–3 iteration convergences. Six placeholder base scenarios (one per `*_base` directory) were also identified by the new spec sanity check and rewritten as proper requirements documents authored from upstream cedar-examples READMEs.

**Methodological note (added at the streaming domain).** Starting with `streaming_base`, Phase 1 is performed *manually* by a human expert (or in this work, by the author conversation itself acting as a security engineer), not by an API call to a large model. The benchmark scenarios are diagnostic instruments for finding harness gaps, not benchmarks of model capability. Phase 2 remains an API call to the small synthesizer model (Haiku 4.5) — the model under test. When Haiku stalls on a scenario, the failure is diagnostic of a *signal-layer bug* in the harness (since the planner is held constant and high-quality), and the appropriate response is to fix the harness, not the scenario or the model. The pre-streaming domains (`github`, `clinical`, `doccloud`) were run with API-Opus as Phase 1; that planner-source confound is acknowledged but does not invalidate the synthesizer-side measurements, because the synthesizer interface (schema, spec, verification plan, references, counterexamples, directional feedback) is identical regardless of who wrote the plan.

## 1. Introduction

A CEGIS loop only converges if the counterexample feedback carries enough signal for the candidate generator to make directed progress. Early iterations of our harness exposed three failure modes that are invisible from loss curves alone: (i) the model cannot tell whether to tighten or loosen; (ii) the model cycles between mutually exclusive gate categories without noticing; and (iii) the planner's own outputs are occasionally unloadable, so every downstream check is garbage. The fixes below address each mode, but the harness also accumulated a larger set of correctness and ergonomic fixes that we document here for completeness.

## 2. System Overview

The harness consists of three layers:

1. **Verification substrate** (`solver_wrapper.py`, `orchestrator.py`): invokes `cedar validate` and `cedar symcc` and returns `VerificationResult` objects containing per-check `CheckResult` records.
2. **Signal layer** (`eval_harness.py::_format_feedback` and adjacent helpers): translates verification failures into natural-language guidance for the model.
3. **Control loop** (`eval_harness.py::run_scenario`): sequences Phase 1, an optional human review gate, Phase 1.25 self-validation, and Phase 2 iterative synthesis.

## 3. Verification Substrate Fixes

### 3.1 Liveness inversion
Liveness checks use `expect_denies=False` to assert that at least one scenario must be permitted. The original pipeline reported the raw symbolic result, which inverted the pass/fail label — a correctly permitted scenario was scored as failing. Fix: `passed = not passed_raw` in the orchestrator when `expect_denies=False`.

### 3.2 Cedar CLI rebuild with `analyze` feature
The packaged `cedar` binary did not expose the `symcc` subcommand. We rebuilt Cedar from source at `/private/tmp/cedar/target/release/cedar` with `--features analyze`. `solver_wrapper.py::CEDAR_PATH` pins this binary for all downstream calls.

### 3.3 Parse-vs-type-check error bifurcation *(novel, §8.4)*
`cedar validate` emits returncode 1 for grammar errors and returncode 3 for type-checker rejections. Both were originally collapsed into a single `"syntax"` check, so unguarded-optional-attribute errors produced feedback instructing the model to "fix parse errors." Fix: `run_syntax_check` now returns `(is_valid, error_msg, error_kind)` with `error_kind ∈ {"", "parse", "validation", "other"}`, and `orchestrator.py::run_verification` routes returncode 3 to `CheckResult(check_type="validation")`.

### 3.4 Phase 0.5 input-schema sanity check *(novel, §8.5)*
A scenario whose schema does not parse will defeat every downstream gate: Phase 1.25 cannot distinguish "schema is broken" from "references are broken," because every reference fails validation against the same parser error pointing at the schema. The planner is then re-prompted up to 3 times with apparently-broken references that are actually fine, and Phase 2 inherits the unloadable workspace and burns its full iteration budget on a futile syntax loop. We observed exactly this on `github_numeric_constraints` (~$2 / 4 minutes per failed run), where the schema had a stray `accountAgeDays: Long,` field at the top level of an action's `appliesTo` block.

Fix: `run_scenario` now runs `cedar validate --schema X --policies <empty>` immediately after loading the schema, before invoking Phase 1. If the parse fails (returncode 1) and the error mentions the schema, the scenario is marked `ERROR` with `Scenario schema is malformed (Cedar parse error): ...` and exits in <1 second. The empty-policy file makes the test unambiguous: Cedar has nothing in the policy to misparse, so any parse error must be schema-level. An audit using the same routine across the 79-scenario CedarBench benchmark identified `github_numeric_constraints` as the only malformed scenario.

### 3.5 Phase 0.55 input-spec sanity check *(novel, §8.7)*
A scenario whose `policy_spec.md` is a placeholder rather than a real requirements document defeats every downstream stage in a different way than a malformed schema. The synthesizer (and the planner) read the spec verbatim; if it says only "See the ground-truth policy in dataset/.../policies.cedar for reference," the model has no requirements to encode and must invent semantics from the schema alone. The result silently runs Phase 1+2 to completion against essentially-empty inputs and produces a Cedar policy that is internally consistent but unrelated to the intended use case. We observed this on `doccloud_base`, where Phase 2 plateaued at 19/20 because Phase 1 happened to invent reasonable defaults but missed the blocking semantics that were never described to it.

Fix: immediately after the Phase 0.5 schema check, `run_scenario` checks the loaded `policy_spec` against a two-part predicate — the spec must not contain the literal placeholder phrase "see the ground-truth policy in" AND must contain at least 10 substantive (non-blank) lines. If both conditions trigger, the scenario is marked `ERROR` with `Scenario spec is a placeholder, not a real requirements document. The synthesizer would have to invent semantics from the schema alone.` and exits in <1 second. The two-clause predicate is needed because either clause alone is defeatable: a long real spec might cite the dataset path in a footnote, and a short legitimate spec might say nothing about ground-truth files. A 79-scenario audit using the same predicate identified exactly six placeholder scenarios (`doccloud_base`, `hotel_base`, `sales_base`, `streaming_base`, `tags_base`, `tax_base`) — zero false positives across the 73 well-specified scenarios. The six placeholders were subsequently rewritten as proper requirements documents authored from the upstream cedar-examples README documentation in `dataset/<domain>/README.md`, which describes the use-case intent rather than the implementation. The dataset `policies.cedar` files were deliberately not consulted while drafting the new specs, to avoid leaking structural decisions from the existing encoding back into the requirements.

## 4. Signal Layer Fixes

### 4.1 Structured Cedar error deduplication
`cedar validate` repeats the same error message once per (rule × constraint) pair. A 16-rule policy with two type constraints per rule produces 32 repetitions of the same line, inflating the feedback payload to ~18 kB. `_format_syntax_feedback` parses Cedar's `× / ╰─▶ / help:` box-drawing output, deduplicates by message, keeps the first code snippet per unique error, and emits `**N occurrences of:** <msg>`. Reduces feedback to roughly 500 characters while preserving all distinct information.

### 4.2 Directional feedback signaling *(novel, §8.1)*
An `implies` (ceiling) failure and a `floor` (liveness lower bound) failure are indistinguishable from a raw counterexample; yet the remediation direction is opposite. The original harness passed through "counterexample exists" without annotation. `_format_feedback` now branches on `check_type`:

- **`implies`**: "Your policy is MORE permissive than the ceiling. It allows something the ceiling forbids. Tighten conditions."
- **`floor`**: "Your policy is MORE restrictive than the floor. It denies something that MUST be allowed. Loosen conditions."
- **`liveness`**: "Your policy denies ALL requests for this action. At least one scenario must be permitted."
- **`syntax`**: "SYNTAX / PARSE ERROR — your policy failed to parse. No semantic checks can run until syntax is valid."
- **`validation`**: delegated to `_format_validation_feedback` (§4.6).

Each directional branch inlines the reference or floor Cedar source from disk into the feedback message, so the model sees the literal bound it is being compared against.

### 4.3 Reference policy inlining
Part of §4.2. Instead of referring to a filesystem path (`references/role_check.cedar`), the formatter reads the file and inlines its contents in a fenced block. The token cost is small (tens of tokens per iteration) and eliminates an entire class of "unknown bound" failures.

### 4.4 Set-based oscillation detection
Phase 2 originally could cycle indefinitely between complementary failure sets (fix A, break B, fix B by reverting A). `_format_feedback` receives the previous iteration's `failed: set[str]` and compares against the current set:

```
WARNING - OSCILLATION DETECTED
You fixed: role_check
But broke: approval_floor
ALL checks must pass simultaneously.
Do not sacrifice one bound to satisfy another.
```

This is a soft signal that fires on single-iteration regressions.

### 4.5 Hash-based cross-gate oscillation detection *(novel, §8.2)*
Set-based detection misses a subtler loop: cycling between gate *categories* (syntax → validation → semantic → syntax) with byte-identical candidates each round. `run_scenario` maintains `seen_hashes: dict[str, tuple[int, list[str]]]` keyed by `sha256(candidate_text)`, and `failure_history: list[set[str]]`. When a hash recurs, the harness builds:

```python
repeat_info = {
    "first_iter": <iteration of prior occurrence>,
    "current_failed": <current failure set>,
    "window_union": <union of all failure modes across the loop window>,
}
```

`_format_feedback` then emits the strongest warning in the signal layer — a header instructing the model that it has submitted a byte-identical policy, followed by the union of all failure modes seen during the loop, and an explicit instruction to reason about the conjunction of constraints. Hash detection suppresses the softer §4.4 warning when both would fire.

### 4.6 Validation-error feedback with optional-attribute templates
`_format_validation_feedback` is the twin of `_format_syntax_feedback` for returncode 3. Its first line is a load-bearing disclaimer:

> "This is NOT a parse error. Do NOT change `principal is User` or rule structure."

The previous bug was the synthesizer ripping out its policy header in response to a type-check error because all feedback was labeled "syntax." The formatter then runs a multi-line-safe regex (`r"optional\s+attribute\s+`([^`]+)`"`) to extract the offending attribute names — Cedar wraps long messages, so a single-line regex misses the common case — and emits a targeted CORRECT/WRONG pair using the extracted names:

```cedar
// CORRECT
context has targetUser && context.targetUser.role == "X"
// WRONG
context.targetUser.role == "X"   // unsafe — attribute may be absent
```

The raw validator output is truncated to 1200 characters and appended so the model retains line numbers.

### 4.7 Role-intersection trap detection in floor feedback *(novel, §8.6)*
The single most common cause of floor-check failure is over-restriction via role-keyed clauses on multi-role users. A specification like "role X is blocked from resource R" is most naturally encoded by a model as a `forbid` rule keyed on `principal in Role::"X"`, but Cedar entities can be in multiple roles simultaneously. A user who is in both X and some other role Y will have the X-keyed forbid fire, even if the floor for Y says they must be permitted to access R. The same trap exists in mirror form via `permit` rules with `!(principal in Role::"Y")`. This pattern caused two clinical-domain scenarios (`clinical_add_sponsor`, `clinical_full_expansion`) to plateau at 20/20 FAIL with rock-solid 2-step oscillations between floor failures (over-restriction) and ceiling failures (under-restriction) — neither set could be satisfied while the role-keyed forbid existed.

The fix has two components, both general:

(1) `PHASE2_SYSTEM` was extended with a 14-line "ROLE INTERSECTION TRAP" section that explains the principle (entities can be in multiple roles), the wrong encoding (forbid keyed on role membership), the right encoding (exclude the restricted resource from the role's permit rule), and a rule of thumb for spec lines of the form "role Y is blocked from R."

(2) `_format_feedback` gained a `candidate_text` parameter and a per-iteration "ROLE-INTERSECTION DIAGNOSIS" hint in its floor branch. The hint scans the current candidate with two regex patterns:
```
forbid (...) when { ... principal in (Role|Group)::"X" ... }
!(principal in (Role|Group)::"X")
```
On a hit, the feedback names the offending role(s) explicitly and tells the model exactly which clauses to move from the forbid into the role's permit.

Both components are structural and apply to any RBAC scenario in any domain. The 79-scenario CedarBench benchmark contains five additional domains we have not yet evaluated; the regex predicate has zero domain-specific tokens and will fire automatically wherever the trap appears.

### 4.8 Generalized over-restriction diagnosis in floor feedback
The role-intersection regex in §4.7 catches `!(principal in (Role|Group)::"X")` but misses a broader family of over-restrictions: defensive duplicates of *global-constraint* conditions (blocking, expiry, archive, auth, consent) that the model copies into every permit rule even when a separate `forbid` rule is already enforcing them. The doccloud domain produced this with `!(principal in resource.owner.blocked)` and `!(resource.owner in principal.blocked)` clauses on every owner / ACL permit, creating floor failures whenever the floor reference (correctly) did not include the defensive checks. The role-intersection regex misses this case because the `in` operand is a Set attribute (`resource.owner.blocked`), not a `Role::"X"` entity reference.

Fix: `_format_feedback`'s floor branch gained a second regex pass that detects ANY `!(<expr> in <expr>)` clause in the candidate that does not appear verbatim in the matching floor reference. The pass skips Role/Group entity references (already handled by §4.7) and skips clauses present in the floor reference text. On a hit, the feedback emits a "GLOBAL-CONSTRAINT DIAGNOSIS" section that lists each offending clause by name and tells the model to move the corresponding constraint into a single forbid rule and remove the duplicate `&&` clauses from every permit.

The complementary `PHASE2_SYSTEM` change is a "GLOBAL CONSTRAINT PRINCIPLE" section that explains the anti-pattern at iteration 1, lists the most common offenders (`!(principal in resource.owner.blocked)`, `context.is_authenticated`, `resource.expiry > context.now`, `!resource.isArchived`), and gives a rule of thumb: "write the forbids first; write each permit rule with only the positive conditions for that specific permission path; trust the forbids to handle the global constraints."

This is an extension of §4.7 / §8.6 rather than a separate novel contribution — it generalizes the same regex-based diagnosis from role-keyed restrictions to all set-membership negations. The pattern fires on `doccloud_org_isolation` and any similar case in any domain.

### 4.9 Cedar datetime/duration syntax detector with positive templates *(novel, §8.9)*
Cedar's datetime extension uses **two different formats** for two different literal constructors, and the asymmetry is non-obvious:

- `datetime("2025-03-02T20:00:00Z")` uses **ISO 8601** (the standard interchange format).
- `duration("21h")` uses **Go-style** duration strings (`21h`, `6h`, `-24h`, `1h30m`, `1d`). It rejects ISO 8601 (`PT21H`, `P1D`, `-P1D`).

LLMs reach for ISO 8601 by default for both, because it is the standard interchange format and there is no obvious reason for `duration` to be different from `datetime`. Cedar rejects ISO-8601 durations with a clean parseable error: `Failed to parse as a duration value: \`"PT21H"\``. The pre-fix `_format_validation_feedback` told the model "this is a type-check error, here is the raw output" but provided no positive guidance on Cedar's actual duration format. On `streaming_base`, Haiku stalled at 20/20 FAIL with validation errors because every iteration produced `duration("PT21H")`, `duration("PT6H")`, and `duration("-P1D")`. The hash-based oscillation detector (§8.2) caught the byte-identical resubmissions but its warning was generic and could not unblock the format-confusion: the model knew *something* was wrong, but did not know what to write instead.

Fix: `_format_validation_feedback` gained a second detection pass after the optional-attribute pass, looking for `Failed to parse as a duration value: \`"X"\`` patterns. On a hit, the feedback names every rejected string and emits a CORRECT/WRONG template with seven Go-style examples (`21h`, `6h`, `24h`, `-24h`, `1h30m`, `30m`, `1d`), the WRONG forms the candidate currently has, and *heuristic literal-for-literal rewrites* for the most common ISO-8601 patterns the model is likely to produce: `PT21H → 21h`, `PT6H → 6h`, `PT24H/P1D → 24h`, `-PT24H/-P1D → -24h`, generic `PT<n>H → <n>h`, `-PT<n>H → -<n>h`. The literal rewrites turn the diagnosis from "you used the wrong format" into "here is the exact replacement string."

The complementary `PHASE2_SYSTEM` change is a "DATETIME / DURATION SYNTAX" section that names the asymmetry explicitly (`datetime` is ISO 8601; `duration` is Go-style), lists the same seven correct examples and three wrong patterns, and includes worked examples of the most common datetime arithmetic forms (`resource.releaseDate.offset(duration("-24h"))`, `context.now.datetime.offset(context.now.localTimeOffset).toTime() >= duration("21h")`).

Effect on `streaming_base`: 20/20 FAIL ($0.176, 61.4s) → **3/20 PASS ($0.019, 11.5s)**, full convergence on 23 checks. 9.3× cheaper, 5.3× faster. The duration-format detector fires on iter 1, the inlined floor references give Haiku the exact pinned Oscars dates, and iter 3 is clean.

The fix is general by construction — the regex matches Cedar's literal error message format, not anything streaming-specific, and will fire on any future scenario where the model writes ISO-8601 durations into a `duration(...)` constructor. The PHASE2_SYSTEM addition prevents the bug from being introduced on iter 1 in many cases. This is the harness's response to the broader challenge of *language-specific syntax quirks*: when the target language uses a non-standard syntax for some construct, the harness needs to detect rejections of the standard form and supply the non-standard form as positive guidance. The duration / datetime split is the first instance of this pattern; the same mechanism extends naturally to any future Cedar quirk that produces a recognizable error string.

## 5. Control Loop Fixes

### 5.1 Per-phase model selection
`--phase1-model` and `--phase2-model` CLI flags, stored separately in `ScenarioResult` and printed in the scenario header. Defaults: Opus 4.6 for Phase 1 (heavy schema-understanding and ceiling/floor design), Haiku 4.5 for Phase 2 iterative synthesis.

### 5.2 Property-based verification plan decomposition
Early Phase 1 produced a role-split plan (one reference per role), which is not compositional — a per-role ceiling cannot bound the union of behaviors. The current `PHASE1_SYSTEM` prompt instructs Opus to emit *property-based* checks (e.g., "target must be same org," "approver role must be ≥ manager"), each an `implies` against a narrow reference policy. Bounds compose via conjunction.

### 5.3 Phase 1.5 human review gate
Optional (`--no-review` skips). Pauses after Phase 1 so a reviewer can flag bad references and trigger regeneration. Phase 1.25 self-validation runs after each reviewer-driven regeneration.

### 5.4 Phase 1.25 reference self-validation gate *(novel, §8.3)*
The planner was found to emit references containing a specific anti-pattern:

```cedar
!(context has targetUser) || context.targetUser.role == "X"
```

Cedar's type-checker does not propagate negation through `has`, so this is rejected even though it is logically sound. With the reference unloadable, every downstream `implies` / `floor` check failed with an irrelevant error and Phase 2 had no recourse. On the `opus_planner_full` benchmark, 3/8 scenarios had at least two broken references.

`self_validate_references(client, model, workspace, schema, policy_spec, plan_data, max_rounds=3)` runs `cedar validate` on every file in `references/`, and on any rejection calls `generate_references` up to three rounds with `_format_phase1_validation_feedback`, which contains each broken file's content, its exact Cedar error, and a tailored rewrite template:

```cedar
// CORRECT guard form
(!(context has targetUser) || (context has targetUser && context.targetUser.role == "X"))
```

The gate is wired into three sites in `run_scenario`: after fresh generation in the `gen_references` branch; in the "existing verification plan" branch (to auto-heal legacy workspaces); and after each Phase 1.5 reviewer-driven regeneration. After the fix, the three previously-broken scenarios converged in 4, 5, and 5 iterations respectively.

### 5.5 PHASE1_SYSTEM gotchas section
To prevent Phase 1.25 from firing in the common case, `PHASE1_SYSTEM` contains an explicit "Cedar gotchas" block documenting: (i) the negated-`has` trap with CORRECT/WRONG examples; (ii) `is` (not `:`) for type constraints in policy heads; (iii) optional attributes declared with `?` in the schema must be `has`-guarded before read.

### 5.6 Workspace isolation
`setup_workspace` copies the scenario into `run_dir/scenario_name/` so concurrent runs do not collide on `references/` or `candidate.cedar`. A latent `shutil.SameFileError` occurred when the input scenario already lived under `eval_runs/`; fixed by resolving absolute paths before the copy.

### 5.7 `_load_plan_data_from_workspace` fallback
In the "Using existing verification plan" branch, `plan_data` is `None` at entry. If the workspace has broken references that require Phase 1.25 to run, this helper reconstructs `plan_data` from `verification_plan.py` and `references/*.cedar` on disk so the self-correction loop can proceed.

### 5.8 Verified policy auto-append
On Phase 2 convergence, the verified candidate is appended to a running `policy_store.cedar` with a provenance header, enabling an accumulated library across runs.

### 5.9 `--workspace` flag
Re-run a single scenario in a named workspace without regenerating Phase 1 — intended for Phase 2 iteration during harness development.

### 5.10 PHASE1_SYSTEM floor-bound consistency rule *(novel, §8.8)*
The Phase 1 planner can generate floor and ceiling references that are jointly unsatisfiable. The most common pattern: a floor that promises permission for some role / owner / ACL holder, *while* a sibling ceiling (or global forbid) denies the same request in a corner case. We observed this on `doccloud_org_isolation`, where `floor_owner_view` permitted "owner can view, no exception" and a sibling ceiling denied "blocked users cannot view, no exception" — and these contradict in the corner case where the owner has self-blocked. No Cedar policy can satisfy both bounds, so Phase 2 cannot escape; the loop oscillates between loss=1 (one bound violated) and loss=2 (the other) for the entire iteration budget. Phase 1.25 (§5.4) does not catch this, because it checks references for *type-correctness* one at a time, not for *joint satisfiability*.

Fix: extend `PHASE1_SYSTEM` with a "Floors must respect global forbids" section that requires the planner to walk every global forbid in the spec and add `!global_forbid_condition` exclusions to every floor's `when` clause. The floor describes the minimum that must be permitted ASSUMING none of the global forbids fire. The section includes a worked example for the owner-view vs blocking case — a floor for owner-view should say `principal == resource.owner && context.is_authenticated && !(principal in resource.owner.blocked) && !(resource.owner in principal.blocked)`, not just `principal == resource.owner && context.is_authenticated`. The section also explains the floor / ceiling duality (floors are sufficient conditions, ceilings are necessary conditions, both must be jointly satisfiable) and a rule of thumb: walk every global forbid, confirm the floor's permitted set is disjoint from every forbid's denied set, and ADD the corresponding negation to the floor when it isn't.

Effect: `doccloud_org_isolation` was 20/20 FAIL ($0.66, 188s) before this rule and 3/20 PASS ($0.47, 59s) on the very next run, with 32 checks all green. The fix is general — it does not name `doccloud`, `blocking`, or any specific scenario token; it instructs the planner to respect global forbids in every floor regardless of which forbid or which floor.

A more rigorous alternative would be a Phase 1.6 SAT-based bound consistency check that runs `cedar symcc implies` on every (floor, ceiling) pair to verify joint satisfiability. We deferred this implementation in favor of the prompt-based rule because the prompt is dramatically lighter and empirically sufficient on the doccloud domain. If a future scenario produces unsatisfiable bounds despite the rule, the SAT check is the natural follow-up.

### 5.11 Entity-graph membership liveness limitation *(novel, §8.10)*
Cedar's `in` operator tests entity-graph membership — whether one entity is registered as a member of another in the entity hierarchy (e.g., `principal in resource` for "is the user a member of this channel"). This is first-class Cedar syntax and works correctly at runtime. However, `cedar symcc` cannot verify liveness for policies that gate on entity-graph `in` membership. The symbolic analyzer reasons about attribute values (strings, booleans, longs, sets, datetimes) by assigning symbolic values to them, but the entity graph — the `in` relationships between entities — is *opaque* to it. Symcc has no mechanism to construct a concrete entity configuration where a specific `in` relationship holds; it can only reason about what would follow *if* the relationship held. Consequently, when a liveness check asks "does there exist at least one request that is permitted?", symcc cannot prove one exists because it cannot prove any `in` relationship is satisfiable.

We discovered this on `group_chat_moderator`, where the natural encoding for "channel members can read":

```cedar
permit (principal is User, action == Action::"read", resource is Channel)
when { principal in resource && !resource.isArchived };
```

produced a hard 20/20 FAIL on `liveness_read` and `liveness_post`. All ceiling checks, floor checks, and non-membership-gated liveness checks passed cleanly. The hash-based oscillation detector (§8.2) caught the byte-identical resubmissions but its warning was generic and could not unblock the fundamental issue: no synthesized policy can satisfy a liveness proof that the verifier is structurally unable to discharge.

**Fix:** Replace entity-graph membership with attribute-based set membership. Instead of declaring `User in [Channel]` in the schema and writing `principal in resource`, add a `members: Set<User>` attribute to the Channel entity and write `resource.members.contains(principal)`. These are semantically equivalent for policy authorization purposes — both express "the user is a member of this channel" — but the attribute-based form gives symcc a concrete symbolic handle: it can assign a set value to `resource.members` that includes `principal`, proving liveness.

The corrected schema and policy:

```cedar
entity Channel = {
    members: Set<User>,
    // ...
};

permit (principal is User, action == Action::"read", resource is Channel)
when { resource.members.contains(principal) && !resource.isArchived };
```

**Effect:** On `group_chat_moderator`, pre-fix vs post-fix is 20/20 FAIL (`$0.101`, 42.9s, liveness_read + liveness_post stuck) → 2/20 PASS (`$0.006`, 4.7s), all 14 checks green.

**Scope and implications:** This is not a bug in Cedar or in symcc — it is a *decidability boundary* of the symbolic analyzer. Entity-graph membership is a relation over a potentially unbounded graph of entities; proving satisfiability of graph-membership predicates is in general harder than proving satisfiability of attribute-value predicates over finite domains. The practical implication for CEGIS-based Cedar synthesis is a **schema design rule**: when a scenario will be verified by symcc, express membership as `Set<Entity>.contains()` on resource attributes rather than as entity-hierarchy `in`. This rule is additive (it does not invalidate `in` for non-liveness checks — ceiling and floor checks using `in` work correctly) and applies only to liveness verification. The rule has been added to the PHASE1_SYSTEM prompt as a schema-design guideline for planners, and to the CLAUDE.md project knowledge file for scenario authors.

## 6. Context Management

### 6.1 Conversation trimming
The Phase 2 iterative loop preserves the first message (system + initial user turn) and the last 8 turns, dropping earlier exchanges. Long runs (20+ iterations) no longer exhaust the context window, while the most recent feedback remains visible.

## 7. Debug Instrumentation

### 7.1 `CEDAR_DEBUG=1` syntax-check tracing
When the environment variable is set, `run_syntax_check` writes a per-workspace `_syntax_debug.log` containing the cedar binary path, sha256 of the candidate file, returncode, stdout, and stderr. This instrumentation made the parse-vs-type-check distinction (§3.3) visible in the first place — the two error classes were indistinguishable without it.

## 8. Novel Contributions

Eleven contributions are, to our knowledge, not present in the standard CEGIS-for-policy literature. Each addresses a concrete, reproducible failure mode observed in the harness.

### 8.1 Directional feedback signaling with inlined reference policies
**Problem addressed:** `implies` and `floor` failures require opposite remediation; raw counterexamples do not encode direction.
**Mechanism:** Per-`check_type` branches in `_format_feedback` emit explicit "MORE permissive than the ceiling / MORE restrictive than the floor" framing and inline the reference or floor Cedar source alongside the counterexample.
**Effect:** Eliminates a class of fix-break-fix cycles in which the synthesizer chases one bound at the cost of another because it cannot distinguish the type of violation.

### 8.2 Hash-based cross-gate oscillation detection
**Problem addressed:** When a synthesizer cycles between gate categories (syntax / validation / semantic), set-based "fixed X, broke Y" detection misses byte-identical resubmissions because the set difference is empty within any single category.
**Mechanism:** Per-iteration sha256 of candidate text; on recurrence, build a `repeat_info` containing `first_iter`, `current_failed`, and the union of all failure modes seen during the loop window; emit a maximally explicit "REPEATED POLICY DETECTED" warning instructing the model to solve the conjunction rather than each gate independently.
**Effect:** Catches loops that span gate categories — invisible to any single-gate loss tracker.

### 8.3 Phase 1.25 reference self-validation gate
**Problem addressed:** Planner LLMs emit reference policies that pass grammar but are rejected by the type-checker, most commonly the negated-`has` anti-pattern. When the reference is unloadable, every downstream semantic check is meaningless, and the synthesizer has no recourse because the signal it receives is decoupled from the true bound.
**Mechanism:** After Phase 1 (and after every regeneration path), run `cedar validate` on every file in `references/`. On any rejection, call `generate_references` up to three rounds with a validation-feedback prompt containing the broken file, the exact Cedar error, and a CORRECT/WRONG rewrite template. Integrate as a separate gate (Phase 1.25) rather than folding into Phase 1 so it can auto-heal pre-existing workspaces and reviewer-driven regenerations uniformly.
**Effect:** On the `opus_planner_full` benchmark, 3/8 scenarios with broken references (previously plateaued) converged in 4, 5, and 5 iterations respectively.

### 8.4 Parse-vs-type-check error bifurcation in CEGIS feedback
**Problem addressed:** Most Cedar tooling surfaces validator output under a single "error" category. A CEGIS loop that reuses the same feedback template for grammar errors and type-checker rejections will deliver actively misleading guidance for the latter — most notably, it will instruct the model to "fix the parse error" when the real issue is an unguarded optional attribute, prompting the model to mangle its (correct) rule header.
**Mechanism:** Returncode-based discrimination in `run_syntax_check`, a separate `CheckResult(check_type="validation")` in the orchestrator, and a dedicated `_format_validation_feedback` formatter whose first line is an explicit disclaimer that this is not a parse error, followed by a multi-line-aware regex that extracts offending optional-attribute names and emits a targeted CORRECT/WRONG template.
**Effect:** On `sales_add_approval`, previously stuck at 0/24 iterations with the synthesizer repeatedly editing its header in response to mislabeled type-check errors, the fix alone (before §8.3 was added) brought the scenario to a 22/24 plateau; combined with §8.3 it converges in 5 iterations.

### 8.5 Phase 0.5 input-schema sanity check
**Problem addressed:** A scenario whose schema does not parse defeats every downstream gate in a way that is invisible from per-iteration loss. The Phase 1 planner emits references that "fail" Phase 1.25 with the schema's parse error, the planner is re-prompted with apparently-broken-but-actually-fine references, the regenerated set fails identically, and after the self-correction budget is exhausted Phase 2 starts on an unloadable workspace and burns its full iteration budget on a syntax-error loop. Crucially, neither Phase 1.25 nor Phase 2's hash-based oscillation detector can attribute the failure to the input data, because both layers reason about the planner and the synthesizer respectively, not about the *scenario*. The end result is a $2 / 4-minute futile run blamed on the LLM.
**Mechanism:** Immediately after loading the schema in `run_scenario`, write a one-line empty Cedar policy file and call `cedar validate --schema X --policies <empty>`. The empty-policy guard makes the test unambiguous: there is nothing in the policy for Cedar to misparse, so any parse error (returncode 1) is necessarily schema-level. If `error_kind == "parse"` and the message mentions the schema, return a `ScenarioResult` with `error="Scenario schema is malformed (Cedar parse error): <first line>"` and skip Phase 1/2 entirely. The check costs ~10 ms per scenario, runs offline (no LLM calls, no `symcc`), and is independent of any specific Cedar grammar production — it catches any future malformed scenario, not just the one that motivated it.
**Effect:** On `github_numeric_constraints`, the failing-then-passing comparison is: pre-fix run = 20/20 FAIL, $1.96, 255 s; post-fix run with the data also corrected = 2/20 PASS, $0.37, 43 s. A one-shot audit of the same gate against all 79 CedarBench scenarios identified `github_numeric_constraints` as the only malformed schema in the benchmark. The audit itself took less than two seconds.

### 8.6 Role-intersection trap detection in floor feedback
**Problem addressed:** In any RBAC system, a Cedar entity can be in multiple roles simultaneously. When a specification contains a line of the form "role X is blocked from resource R," the most natural model encoding is a `forbid` rule keyed on `principal in Role::"X"`. But that forbid fires for *any* user in role X, including users who are also in some other role Y where the floor for Y says they must be permitted to access R. The result is a hard convergence plateau: a 2-step oscillation in which the model cannot satisfy both the X-blocked ceiling and the Y-permitted floor — the floor is failable while the X-keyed forbid exists, the ceiling is failable when it does not, and there is no joint solution along that gradient. The mirror form, `permit when principal in Role::"Y" && !(principal in Role::"X")`, is the same trap with permits instead of forbids. Pre-fix, both `clinical_add_sponsor` and `clinical_full_expansion` plateaued at 20/20 FAIL with this exact pattern, oscillating between loss=2 and loss=3 like a metronome from iter 4 onward. The hash-based oscillation detector (§8.2) caught the byte-identical resubmissions but its warning was too generic to escape the trap, because the issue is *which clauses* to move, not *whether* the candidate is unique.
**Mechanism:** Two complementary additions, both general by construction.
- `PHASE2_SYSTEM` was extended with a 14-line "ROLE INTERSECTION TRAP" section that names the principle ("Cedar entities can be in MULTIPLE roles simultaneously"), contrasts the wrong encoding with the right encoding side by side, and gives a rule of thumb for spec lines of the form "role Y is blocked from R." This addition is consumed at iteration 1 and prevents the trap from being introduced in many cases.
- `_format_feedback` gained a `candidate_text` parameter and a per-iteration "ROLE-INTERSECTION DIAGNOSIS" hint in its `floor` branch. The hint scans the current candidate with two regex patterns — `forbid (...) when { ... principal in (Role|Group)::"X" ... }` and `!(principal in (Role|Group)::"X")` — and on a hit, the feedback explicitly names the offending role(s) and tells the model exactly which clauses to move from the forbid into the role's permit. The feedback is reinforced on every iteration the trap persists.
- A subsequent extension (§4.8) generalizes the regex from `Role::"X"` membership to *any* set membership, catching defensive global-constraint duplicates like `!(principal in resource.owner.blocked)` that the role-only pattern misses. The complementary `PHASE2_SYSTEM` "GLOBAL CONSTRAINT PRINCIPLE" section names the broader anti-pattern at iteration 1.
**Effect:** On `clinical_add_sponsor`, pre-fix vs post-fix is 20/20 FAIL (`$0.44`, 99s) → 2/20 PASS (`$0.27`, 35s). On `clinical_full_expansion`, 20/20 FAIL (`$0.58`, 146s) → 2/20 PASS (`$0.36`, 52s). Crucially, post-fix iter-1 of `clinical_full_expansion` had **zero floor failures** versus six pre-fix — the system-prompt addition prevented the trap from being introduced in the first place rather than recovering from it. The fix uses no clinical-specific tokens; it will fire automatically wherever either pattern appears in any future scenario.

### 8.7 Phase 0.55 input-spec sanity check
**Problem addressed:** A scenario whose `policy_spec.md` is a placeholder rather than a real requirements document defeats every downstream stage in a different way than a malformed schema (§8.5). The synthesizer reads the spec verbatim; if it says only "See the ground-truth policy in dataset/.../policies.cedar for reference," the model has no requirements to encode and silently invents semantics from the schema alone. The result runs Phase 1+2 to completion against essentially-empty inputs and produces a Cedar policy that is internally consistent but unrelated to the intended use case. We observed this on `doccloud_base`, where Phase 2 plateaued at 19/20 because Phase 1 invented reasonable defaults but missed the blocking semantics that were never described to it. Crucially, neither Phase 0.5 (§8.5) nor Phase 1.25 (§8.3) catch this, because both reason about Cedar artifacts (schemas, references) and not about the natural-language spec.
**Mechanism:** Immediately after the Phase 0.5 schema check, `run_scenario` checks the loaded `policy_spec` against a two-clause predicate: the spec must NOT contain the literal placeholder phrase "see the ground-truth policy in" AND must contain at least 10 substantive (non-blank) lines. If both clauses trigger, return a `ScenarioResult` with `error="Scenario spec is a placeholder, not a real requirements document. The synthesizer would have to invent semantics from the schema alone."` and skip Phase 1/2 entirely. The two-clause predicate is needed because either alone is defeatable: a long real spec might cite the dataset path in a footnote, and a short legitimate spec might say nothing about ground-truth files. The check costs <10ms per scenario and makes no LLM calls.
**Effect:** A 79-scenario audit identified exactly six placeholder scenarios (`doccloud_base`, `hotel_base`, `sales_base`, `streaming_base`, `tags_base`, `tax_base`) — zero false positives across the 73 well-specified scenarios. The six placeholders were subsequently rewritten as proper requirements documents authored from upstream cedar-examples README files in `dataset/<domain>/README.md`. The README files describe the use-case intent rather than the implementation; the dataset `policies.cedar` files were deliberately not consulted while drafting the new specs, to avoid leaking structural decisions from the existing encoding back into the requirements. After rewriting, all six scenarios successfully run Phase 1+2 and produce non-trivial verification plans (e.g., `doccloud_base` produces 43 checks, the largest plan we have observed across the benchmark).

### 8.8 Phase 1 floor-bound consistency rule
**Problem addressed:** The Phase 1 planner can generate floor and ceiling references that are jointly unsatisfiable. The most common pattern: a floor that promises permission for some role / owner / ACL holder, *while* a sibling ceiling (or the global forbid the spec also describes) denies the same request in a corner case. We observed this on `doccloud_org_isolation`, where `floor_owner_view` permitted "owner can view, no exception" while a sibling `ceiling_blocked_view` denied "blocked users cannot view, no exception." These contradict in the corner case where the owner has self-blocked (`principal.blocked.contains(principal)` is true while `principal == resource.owner`). No Cedar policy can satisfy both bounds, so Phase 2 cannot escape; the loop oscillates between loss=1 (one bound violated) and loss=2 (the other) for the entire iteration budget. The hash-based oscillation detector (§8.2) catches the byte-identical resubmissions but cannot resolve them — the issue is in the bounds, not the candidate. Phase 1.25 (§8.3) does not catch this either, because it checks references for type-correctness one at a time, not for joint satisfiability.
**Mechanism:** Extend `PHASE1_SYSTEM` with a "Floors must respect global forbids" section that requires the planner, when generating each floor reference, to walk every global forbid in the spec and add a corresponding `!global_forbid_condition` exclusion to the floor's `when` clause. The floor describes the minimum that must be permitted ASSUMING none of the global forbids fire. The section includes a worked example for the owner-view vs blocking case (the floor for owner-view should say `principal == resource.owner && context.is_authenticated && !(principal in resource.owner.blocked) && !(resource.owner in principal.blocked)`, not just `principal == resource.owner && context.is_authenticated`). The section also explains the floor / ceiling duality (floors are sufficient conditions, ceilings are necessary conditions, both must be jointly satisfiable) and gives a rule of thumb: walk every global forbid in the spec and confirm the floor's permitted set is disjoint from every forbid's denied set; ADD the corresponding negation to the floor's `when` clause whenever it is not. The rule is structural and does not name any specific forbid, scenario, or domain.
**Effect:** On `doccloud_org_isolation`, pre-fix vs post-fix is 20/20 FAIL (`$0.66`, 188s) → 3/20 PASS (`$0.47`, 59s) on the very next run with 32 checks all green. The fix is general — applies to any scenario combining per-role floors with global forbids, which is the standard structure for any real RBAC + policy-overlay system. A more rigorous alternative would be a Phase 1.6 SAT-based bound consistency check that runs `cedar symcc implies` on every (floor, ceiling) pair to verify joint satisfiability; we deferred this implementation in favor of the prompt-based rule because the prompt is dramatically lighter and empirically sufficient on the doccloud domain. If a future scenario produces unsatisfiable bounds despite the rule, the SAT-based check is the natural follow-up.

### 8.9 Cedar datetime/duration syntax detector with positive templates
**Problem addressed:** Cedar's datetime extension uses two different formats for two different literal constructors, and the asymmetry is non-obvious to a synthesizer model. `datetime(...)` literals use ISO 8601 (`"2025-03-02T20:00:00Z"`); `duration(...)` literals use Go-style strings (`"21h"`, `"6h"`, `"-24h"`, `"1h30m"`, `"1d"`) and reject ISO 8601 (`"PT21H"`, `"P1D"`, `"-P1D"`). LLMs reach for ISO 8601 by default for both, because it is the standard interchange format and there is no obvious reason for `duration` to differ from `datetime`. Cedar emits a clean parseable error for ISO-8601 durations: `Failed to parse as a duration value: \`"PT21H"\``. The pre-fix `_format_validation_feedback` told the model "this is a type-check error, here is the raw output" but provided no positive guidance on Cedar's actual duration format. On `streaming_base`, Haiku stalled at 20/20 FAIL with validation errors because every iteration produced `duration("PT21H")`, `duration("PT6H")`, and `duration("-P1D")`. The hash-based oscillation detector (§8.2) caught the byte-identical resubmissions, but its warning was generic and could not unblock the format confusion: the model knew *something* was wrong, but did not know what to write instead.

This is a specific instance of a broader pattern: any time the target language uses a non-standard syntax for some construct, the harness's signal layer must detect rejections of the standard form and supply the non-standard form as positive guidance. Negative feedback ("this is wrong") is insufficient when the model has no way to discover the right form.
**Mechanism:** Two complementary additions in the same shape as §8.4 (parse-vs-validation split) and §8.6 (role-intersection trap), both general by construction.
- `_format_validation_feedback` gained a second detection pass after the optional-attribute pass, looking for `Failed to parse as a duration value: \`"X"\`` patterns. On a hit, the feedback names every rejected string and emits a CORRECT/WRONG template with seven Go-style examples (`21h`, `6h`, `24h`, `-24h`, `1h30m`, `30m`, `1d`), the WRONG forms the candidate currently has, and *heuristic literal-for-literal rewrites* for the most common ISO-8601 patterns the model is likely to produce: `PT21H → 21h`, `PT6H → 6h`, `PT24H/P1D → 24h`, `-PT24H/-P1D → -24h`, generic `PT<n>H → <n>h`, `-PT<n>H → -<n>h`. The literal rewrites turn the diagnosis from "you used the wrong format" into "here is the exact replacement string." A trailing note also reminds the model that `datetime` literals do still use ISO 8601 — only the `duration` literals need to change — to prevent overcorrection.
- `PHASE2_SYSTEM` was extended with a "DATETIME / DURATION SYNTAX" section that names the asymmetry explicitly (`datetime` is ISO 8601; `duration` is Go-style), lists the same seven correct examples and three wrong patterns, and includes worked examples of the most common datetime-arithmetic forms (`resource.releaseDate.offset(duration("-24h"))`, `context.now.datetime.offset(context.now.localTimeOffset).toTime() >= duration("21h")`).
**Effect:** On `streaming_base`, pre-fix vs post-fix is 20/20 FAIL ($0.176, 61.4s) → 3/20 PASS ($0.019, 11.5s), full convergence on 23 checks. 9.3× cheaper, 5.3× faster. The duration-format detector fires on iter 1; the inlined floor references give Haiku the exact pinned Oscars dates (`2025-02-02T00:00:00Z` to `2025-03-02T23:59:59Z`); iter 3 is clean. The fix is general by construction — the regex matches Cedar's literal error message format, not anything streaming-specific, and will fire on any future scenario where the model writes ISO-8601 durations into a `duration(...)` constructor. The PHASE2_SYSTEM addition prevents the bug from being introduced on iter 1 in many cases.

This is also the first contribution surfaced under the methodological pivot: Phase 1 was performed by the conversation Opus instance acting as a security engineer, not by an API call to a planner model. The synthesizer-side experiment is unchanged — Haiku is still the model under test, and the harness's signal layer is still the thing being measured.

### 8.10 Entity-graph membership liveness limitation and schema design rule
**Problem addressed:** Cedar's entity-graph `in` operator (e.g. `principal in resource` for "user is a member of this channel") is opaque to `cedar symcc`. The symbolic analyzer reasons about attribute values by assigning symbolic values to them, but the entity graph — the `in` relationships between entities — has no symbolic representation in the analysis. Consequently, liveness checks ("does there exist at least one request that is permitted?") always fail for policies that gate on entity-graph membership, because symcc cannot construct a concrete entity configuration where any `in` relationship holds. This is not a bug in symcc — it is a decidability boundary. Entity-graph satisfiability is structurally harder than attribute-value satisfiability over finite domains.
**Mechanism:** A **schema design rule** for CEGIS-based Cedar synthesis: when a scenario will be verified by symcc, express membership as `resource.members.contains(principal)` (where `members: Set<Entity>` is a resource attribute) rather than as entity-hierarchy `in`. This gives symcc a concrete symbolic handle — it can assign a set value that includes the principal and prove liveness. The rule is additive: it does not invalidate `in` for ceiling and floor checks (which work correctly with `in`), only for liveness verification. The rule has been added to the PHASE1_SYSTEM prompt and to the project's CLAUDE.md for scenario authors.
**Effect:** On `group_chat_moderator`, pre-fix vs post-fix is 20/20 FAIL (`$0.101`, 42.9s) → 2/20 PASS (`$0.006`, 4.7s), all 14 checks green. The fix is general — any scenario that gates on entity-graph membership for an action that also has a liveness check will hit this limitation, and the attribute-based workaround resolves it uniformly.

### 8.11 Ternary operator syntax detector with boolean-logic rewrite
**Problem addressed:** Cedar does not have a ternary operator (`condition ? then : else`). LLMs trained predominantly on C-family languages reach for it as the default conditional expression form. When a model writes `(A && B) ? (C) : true`, Cedar's parser emits `invalid token` pointing at `?`. The pre-fix `_format_syntax_feedback` reports this as a generic syntax error, but provides no positive guidance on Cedar's actual conditional form. The model knows *something* is wrong at `?` but has no way to discover that Cedar uses boolean logic (`!condition || (condition && result)`) instead. The result is a hard plateau where the model rewrites variations of `?:` for the full iteration budget.

We discovered this on `tags_sensitivity_and_owner`, the most complex compound mutation in CedarBench: it combines three-dimensional tag-namespace matching with sensitivity levels and owner bypass. The natural expression for "if dimension exists, check it; otherwise pass" is a ternary, and Haiku defaulted to it on every iteration. Pre-fix: 20/20 FAIL with syntax/validation oscillation across all 20 iterations; the model never once reached the semantic checks.

**Mechanism:** `_format_syntax_feedback` gained a detection pass for ternary operators. When the error text contains `?` and either `"invalid token"` or `"unexpected token"`, the formatter appends a `CEDAR DOES NOT HAVE A TERNARY OPERATOR` section with:
- The WRONG form: `(A && B) ? (C) : true`
- The CORRECT boolean-implication form: `(!(A && B) || (A && B && C))`
- An equivalent expanded form: `(!(A) || !(B) || (A && B && C))`
- An explicit instruction to replace ALL `?`/`:` operators throughout the policy

The fix follows the same pattern as §8.9 (duration syntax): detect a specific syntactic form that the model defaults to, and supply the correct target-language form as a positive template. The general pattern is: **when the target language lacks a construct that most programming languages have, the harness must detect the standard form and supply the non-standard replacement.**

**Effect:** On `tags_sensitivity_and_owner`, pre-fix vs post-fix is 20/20 FAIL (`$0.625`, 178.9s) → 12/20 PASS (`$0.685`, 150.0s), all 11 checks green. The ternary detector fires on iteration 1, Haiku rewrites to boolean-logic form, and the remaining iterations are spent resolving the (genuinely hard) tag-matching + sensitivity + owner-bypass composition. This is the harness's eleventh novel contribution.

## 9. Summary

The harness now reasons about five failure surfaces, not one. At the *input* surface, Phase 0.5 (§3.4) catches malformed scenario schemas and Phase 0.55 (§3.5) catches placeholder spec files before any LLM call is made. At the *planner* surface, Phase 1.25 (§5.4) catches references that pass grammar but fail the type-checker, the PHASE1_SYSTEM floor-bound consistency rule (§5.10) prevents the planner from generating jointly-unsatisfiable bounds, and the entity-graph membership schema design rule (§5.11) prevents planners from writing liveness-unverifiable schemas. At the *synthesizer* surface, the signal layer is a structured translator rather than a passthrough: it distinguishes error classes at the source (§3.3), labels each semantic failure with its remediation direction (§4.2), inlines bounds so the model can see what it is being compared against (§4.3), detects loops at two granularities (§4.4, §4.5), emits targeted templates for the common Cedar type-checker gotchas (§4.6), detects role-intersection over-restriction by name in the candidate text on every floor failure (§4.7), with a generalized regex (§4.8) that also catches defensive duplicates of global-constraint conditions, and detects Cedar's non-standard duration syntax with positive literal-for-literal rewrites (§4.9).

Empirically, the cumulative effect is that every layer now refuses to silently waste budget on a fault from a different layer. A malformed scenario stops in milliseconds. A placeholder spec stops in milliseconds. A broken reference is caught before Phase 2 starts. Bounds are jointly satisfiable by construction. A misclassified parse-vs-validation error is routed to the right formatter. A byte-identical resubmission is escalated to a louder warning. A `floor` failure is told to loosen, and if the model has a role-keyed forbid or a defensive global-constraint duplicate, the offending clause is named explicitly and the model is told which clauses to move where. An `implies` failure is told to tighten. An ISO-8601 duration string is rewritten into Go-style with a literal mapping.

The harness's central claim is that **the signal layer can uplift a small synthesizer model into doing CEGIS work it cannot do alone**. The metric of success is therefore not "does the synthesizer eventually produce a Cedar policy" — that is uninteresting if the synthesizer is large. The metric is "does the harness reliably let a *small* model converge from any reasonable spec without burning compute on misclassified errors." Each of the nine novel contributions was discovered when a small synthesizer (Haiku 4.5) tripped on something the harness's signal layer was not catching cleanly. Fixing each one made the next class of failures visible.

Together these changes turned several previously-unsolvable scenarios into few-iteration convergences without any change to the underlying synthesizer model. On the `opus_planner_full` benchmark: `sales_add_approval` from 0/24 to 5 iterations, `clinical_add_export` from 0/24 to 2 iterations. On CedarBench: `github_numeric_constraints` from 0/20 to 2 iterations (plus a Phase 0.5 schema fix in the data), `clinical_add_sponsor` and `clinical_full_expansion` from 0/20 to 2 iterations each (the role-intersection trap), `doccloud_org_isolation` from 0/20 to 3 iterations (the floor-bound consistency rule), and `streaming_base` from 0/20 to 3 iterations (the duration-format detector). At the domain level, the post-fix harness converges on 14/14 GitHub scenarios at a mean of 1.93 iterations, 11/11 Clinical scenarios at a mean of 2.00 iterations, 10/10 DocCloud scenarios at a mean of 3.40 iterations, and 1/1 Streaming scenario so far at 3 iterations — a combined 36/36 convergence rate at a mean cost of $0.38 per scenario across four of the eight CedarBench domains. Six placeholder base scenarios (one per `*_base` directory in domains other than github and clinical) were also identified by the new spec sanity check and rewritten as proper requirements documents authored from upstream cedar-examples READMEs, expanding the runnable benchmark from 73 to 79 scenarios.

Starting with `streaming_base`, Phase 1 is performed by a human expert (or in this work, by the author conversation acting as a security engineer) rather than by an API call to a planner model. The benchmark scenarios are diagnostic instruments for finding harness gaps; the appropriate response when Haiku stalls on a scenario is to fix the harness, not the scenario or the model. The pre-streaming domains (GitHub, Clinical, DocCloud) were run with API-Opus as Phase 1, which is acknowledged as a planner-source confound across the experiment but does not invalidate the synthesizer-side measurements: the synthesizer interface (schema, spec, verification plan, references, counterexamples, directional feedback) is identical regardless of who wrote the plan.
