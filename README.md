# CedarForge

`cedarforge/` is a research workspace for building a fine-grained multi-agent system that can use open-source small models to generate Cedar access control policies from a policy description and a schema.

The target is not just to produce policy text, but to produce policies that are:

- syntactically correct
- semantically aligned with the intended access-control requirements
- good enough to approach the behavior of frontier models through system design, verification, and iterative repair

## Why This Exists

Many large enterprises do not want to send internal access-control specifications, schemas, or policy logic to public hosted frontier models.

Because of that, they need a deployable local alternative:

- self-hosted open-source models
- private inference endpoints
- controlled prompting and orchestration
- formal verification loops to compensate for weaker model capability

`cedarforge/` exists to explore how far we can push that setup.

## Core Research Goal

Build a multi-agent Cedar policy generation system in which open-source small models can, from:

- a natural-language policy description
- a Cedar schema

produce an access-control policy that is:

- syntax-correct under Cedar validation
- semantically aligned with the intended policy
- repairable through verifier feedback when the first draft is wrong

## Working Hypothesis

Small open-source models will usually not match frontier models in raw one-shot policy synthesis.

But they may get close if the system around them is strong enough.

That system may include:

- task decomposition across multiple agents
- explicit planning before synthesis
- retrieval of reference patterns
- structured verifier feedback
- counterexample-guided repair
- oscillation detection
- constrained output formats
- iterative search over candidate policies

The main idea is to use system design and formal methods to recover capability that the base small model does not have on its own.

## Relation To The Main Repo

The parent `cedar-synthesis-engine` repo provides the verification backbone:

- `orchestrator.py` for Cedar validation and symbolic verification
- `eval_harness.py` for CEGIS-style evaluation
- `cedar symcc` and `cvc5` for formal checks
- scenario packaging with schema, policy spec, references, and verification plans

`cedarforge/` builds on top of that foundation and focuses on the model/system side:

- open-source small-model evaluation
- local endpoint integration
- multi-agent workflow design
- prompt and feedback strategy design
- benchmark task curation

## Current Layout

- [target/project_goal.md](target/project_goal.md): project motivation and notes
- [dataset/](dataset): draft or local scenario inputs
- [src/test_lm.py](src/test_lm.py): quick local model endpoint test
- [src/experiments/](src/experiments): scratch experiment notes
- [SETUP_COMMANDS.md](SETUP_COMMANDS.md): environment setup and verification commands

## Immediate Directions

- define the multi-agent roles needed for Cedar generation
- connect local open-source model endpoints to the synthesis loop
- measure syntax correctness and semantic alignment separately
- study which scaffolding techniques most improve small-model performance
- determine how close verifier-guided small models can get to frontier-model behavior
