# Streaming Service — Policy Specification

## Context

This policy governs access control for a streaming video platform with
FreeMember and Subscriber principals, and Movie and Show resources.

Subscribers have a `subscription` with a `tier` (e.g. "standard", "premium")
and a `profile` with an `isKid` boolean.

## Requirements

### 1. Subscriber Watch Permissions
- A **Subscriber** may **watch** any Show, UNLESS the show has `isEarlyAccess == true`
  AND the current time (`context.now.datetime`) is before the show's `releaseDate`.
- A **Subscriber** may **watch** any Movie, UNLESS the movie has `needsRentOrBuy == true`.

### 2. FreeMember Watch Permissions
- A **FreeMember** may **watch** any Movie where `isFree == true`.
- A **FreeMember** may **watch** any Show where `isFree == true`.

### 3. Oscar Promo (Rent/Buy Window)
- A **Subscriber** may **rent** or **buy** a Movie IF the movie has `isOscarNominated == true`
  AND the current time is within the Oscar promo window:
  `datetime("2025-02-01T00:00:00Z")` to `datetime("2025-03-31T23:59:59Z")`.

### 4. Early Access for Premium Subscribers
- A **Subscriber** with `subscription.tier == "premium"` may **watch** a Show
  that has `isEarlyAccess == true` even before the `releaseDate`, as long as
  the current time is within 24 hours before the `releaseDate`
  (i.e. `context.now.datetime >= resource.releaseDate.offset(duration("-24h"))`).

### 5. Kid Bedtime Restriction (Deny Rule)
- If a Subscriber's `profile.isKid == true`, the **watch** action is forbidden
  outside of 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM local time.
  Local time is computed using `context.now.datetime.offset(context.now.localTimeOffset)`.
  Specifically, forbid watch when the local time-of-day is before 06:00 or at/after 21:00.

## Notes
- Cedar denies by default — no explicit deny-by-default needed.
- Temporal comparisons use Cedar's `datetime` and `duration` extension types.
- The bedtime rule is a `forbid` that overrides any `permit`.
### 6. Parental Controls — Rating Restriction (Deny Rule)
- Each Movie and Show has a `rating: String` attribute with values: `"G"`, `"PG"`, `"PG13"`, or `"R"`.
- Each Subscriber profile has a `maxRating: String` attribute (same possible values).
- The rating hierarchy is: G < PG < PG13 < R.
- If a content's rating exceeds the profile's `maxRating`, the **watch** action is forbidden.
  Specifically:
  - If `maxRating == "G"`: only `"G"` content is allowed.
  - If `maxRating == "PG"`: `"G"` and `"PG"` content are allowed.
  - If `maxRating == "PG13"`: `"G"`, `"PG"`, and `"PG13"` content are allowed.
  - If `maxRating == "R"`: all content is allowed.
- This applies to all Subscriber profiles (both kid and non-kid).

### 7. Kid Bedtime + Parental Controls Interaction
- Kid profiles (`profile.isKid == true`) are subject to BOTH:
  (a) The bedtime restriction (no watching outside 6AM-9PM local time), AND
  (b) The parental rating restriction based on `profile.maxRating`.
- Both forbid rules operate independently — either one can block access.

## Notes (Parental Controls)
- Since Cedar has no built-in rating comparison, the rating hierarchy must be encoded
  as explicit string comparisons in forbid conditions.
- A kid profile with `maxRating == "PG"` is restricted both by time (bedtime) and by content rating.
- FreeMember principals have no profile and are NOT subject to parental controls.
