# Tax Preparer Permissions -- Policy Specification

## Context

This policy governs access control for a tax preparation platform within the
`Taxpreparer` namespace. The system has Professionals, Documents, and Clients.

Professionals have `assigned_orgs: Set<orgInfo>` where each orgInfo contains
`organization`, `serviceline`, and `location` strings. They also have a
`location: String` attribute.

Documents have `serviceline`, `location`, and `owner: Client` attributes.
Clients have an `organization: String`.

Access requires a context record containing `consent: Consent`, where Consent
has `client: Client` and `team_region_list: Set<String>`.

## Requirements

### 1. Organization-Level Access
- A Professional may **viewDocument** if the professional's `assigned_orgs`
  set contains a record matching the document's owner organization, serviceline,
  and location. Specifically:
  `principal.assigned_orgs.contains({organization: resource.owner.organization, serviceline: resource.serviceline, location: resource.location})`.

### 2. Ad-Hoc Access (Per Linked Template)
- Individual (principal, resource) pairs may be granted ad-hoc viewDocument
  access via linked policy templates. These are expressed as:
  `permit(principal == ?principal, action == Taxpreparer::Action::"viewDocument", resource == ?resource)`.

### 3. Consent Requirement (Deny Rule)
- All viewDocument access is **forbidden** unless the consent context satisfies:
  - `context.consent.client == resource.owner` (consent is from the document's owner), AND
  - `context.consent.team_region_list.contains(principal.location)` (the professional's
    location is in the consent's team region list).
- This forbid/unless applies universally -- it blocks both organization-level
  and ad-hoc access unless consent is provided.

## Notes
- All entities and actions are in the `Taxpreparer` namespace.
- The consent forbid uses an `unless` clause to express the requirement.
- Cedar denies by default; the consent forbid is an additional restriction
  on top of the permit rules.
### 4. Sensitive Document Restriction (Deny Rule)
- Document now has an `isSensitive: Bool` attribute.
- If a document has `isSensitive == true`, the **viewDocument** action is
  **forbidden** unless the consent's `team_region_list` contains the
  string `"HQ"`.
- Specifically: `forbid ... when { resource.isSensitive } unless { context.consent.team_region_list.contains("HQ") }`.
- This is an ADDITIONAL restriction on top of the existing consent requirement.
  For sensitive documents, the professional's location must be in the consent
  region list (existing rule) AND the region list must include "HQ" (new rule).
- Non-sensitive documents are unaffected by this rule.

## Notes (Sensitivity)
- The sensitive-document forbid interacts with the existing consent forbid.
  Both forbids must be satisfied (i.e., neither must block) for access to proceed.
