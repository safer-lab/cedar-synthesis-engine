# Document Cloud Permissions -- Policy Specification

## Context

This policy governs access control for a document management platform with
Documents, Users, Groups, Drives, and sharing ACLs (DocumentShare).

Documents have three ACL attributes (viewACL, modifyACL, manageACL), each
referencing a DocumentShare entity that Groups and Public can be members of.
Documents also have a publicAccess string attribute and an owner reference.

## Requirements

### 1. Owner Permissions
- The **owner** of a document may perform ALL actions on that document:
  ViewDocument, ModifyDocument, DeleteDocument, EditIsPrivate, EditPublicAccess,
  AddToShareACL.

### 2. View ACL Permissions
- A user who is in a document's **viewACL** may **ViewDocument**.

### 3. Modify ACL Permissions
- A user who is in a document's **modifyACL** may **ModifyDocument**.

### 4. Manage ACL Permissions
- A user who is in a document's **manageACL** may perform:
  **AddToShareACL**, **DeleteDocument**, **EditIsPrivate**, **EditPublicAccess**.

### 5. Public Access Rules
- If a document's `publicAccess == "view"`, then **Public** principals (or any
  authenticated user) may **ViewDocument**.
- If a document's `publicAccess == "edit"`, then **Public** principals may
  **ViewDocument** and **ModifyDocument**.

### 6. Blocking Rules (Deny Rules -- Bidirectional)
- If the **principal** is in the document owner's **blocked** set, forbid
  **ViewDocument** and **ModifyDocument**.
- If the document **owner** is in the principal's **blocked** set, forbid
  **ViewDocument** and **ModifyDocument**.
- Blocking is bidirectional: either direction triggers the deny.

### 7. Authentication Requirement (Deny Rule)
- For **User** principals, all actions are forbidden unless
  `context.is_authenticated == true`.

### 8. Group Owner Permissions
- The **owner** of a Group may **DeleteGroup** and **ModifyGroup** on that Group.

## Notes
- ACL membership is checked via `principal in resource.viewACL` (etc.).
- The Public entity type is a separate principal type, not a User.
- Cedar denies by default -- no explicit deny-by-default policy is needed.
- Blocking forbid rules use `when` conditions on entity attribute sets.
### 9. Temporal Sharing (Deny Rule with Owner Exception)
- Documents have a `shareExpiry` attribute (Long, epoch timestamp).
- The context includes `requestTime` (Long, epoch timestamp) for document actions.
- If `context.requestTime > resource.shareExpiry`, ACL-based access is revoked:
  forbid **ViewDocument**, **ModifyDocument**, **AddToShareACL**,
  **EditIsPrivate**, **EditPublicAccess** for users accessing via ACLs.
- **Exception**: The document **owner** is NOT affected by share expiry.
  The owner retains full access (all actions) regardless of shareExpiry.
- **Exception**: **DeleteDocument** by the owner is always allowed.
- Public access rules are also affected by share expiry -- if shares have
  expired, public access is revoked.

### 10. Version Lock (Deny Rule)
- Documents have an `isLocked` boolean attribute.
- If `resource.isLocked == true`, forbid **ModifyDocument** for ALL users
  (including the owner and users in modifyACL).
- **DeleteDocument** is still allowed on locked documents.
- **ViewDocument** and management actions (AddToShareACL, EditIsPrivate,
  EditPublicAccess) are still allowed on locked documents.

## Notes (Temporal Sharing + Version Lock)
- Two independent forbid rules interact: share expiry and version lock.
- The share expiry forbid must use `unless { principal == resource.owner }`.
- The version lock forbid applies universally with no exceptions.
- A locked, expired document: owner can view/delete but not modify;
  non-owners cannot access at all.
